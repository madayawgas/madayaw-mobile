> [!NOTE]
> * **Plant Supervisor**: Oversees Bunawan refilling yard bulk physical inventory, supplier purchases, defect quarantining, and yard return receiving. Has total control of master plant stock, but no direct control on vehicle fleet stock.
> * **Sales Supervisor**: Oversees frontline sales, customers, transactions, delivery fulfillment, vehicle stock, and post-trip reconciliation. Has full control of vehicle fleet stock, but limited control to plant stock (strictly moving between plant and vehicles via dispatch loads and return unloads).
> * **Multi-Role Employees**: Users assigned multiple roles (such as an employee holding both `Sales Supervisor` and `Logistics Supervisor`) automatically receive the union of all permissions across their assigned roles.
> * **Driver Role**: The Driver role has no login access or system permissions. Driver records exist in the database for assignment to fleet vehicles.
> * **Legacy Role Aliases**: `Fleet Manager` maps to `Logistics Supervisor`; `Sales Manager` maps to `Sales Supervisor`.
